            <h2>What is a barcamp</h2>
            <p>
              You got the basic idea: A barcamp is community driven and everyone
              can step up with a topic. But how does it work exactly? Letâ€™s
              break the event down into smaller chunks.
              <br /><br />
              First, you introduce yourself to everyone else using only three
              words. The goal here is not to recognize a hundred people, but to
              get a general idea of what knowledgebase and topics we have.
              <br /><br />
              After that everyone is encouraged to propose a topic to fill
              today's session plan.
              <br /><br />
              These sessions are then scheduled and divided into the available
              rooms.
              <br /><br />
              Thatâ€™s it. The fun begins. ðŸŽ‰ You are free to attend any session
              and share your knowledge, meet people and engage others.
